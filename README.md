# NBA-Season-Stats-Scraper

The purpose of this project was to the Per Game and Advanced statistics from the 2018-2020 NBA seasons into one dataset. There were no public datasets with the required fields for the given years. Due to there being no API and not allowing requests to get the needed data from Basketball-Reference, I needed a work around to complete the task. The program leverges selenium to get the page source from Basketball-Reference and uses beautifulsoup to parse through the data.
